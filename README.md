## 🏗️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ **Local Data**
The app reads movies, series, and games from bundled JSON files.

### 2️⃣ **Album & Soundtrack Lookup**
MusicKit fetches:
- Album metadata  
- Song list  
- Preview URLs  

### 3️⃣ **Spotify API via Secure Backend**
Swift app → Flask server → Spotify API  
This keeps your API keys hidden from the client.

### 4️⃣ **Preview Playback**
AVPlayer is used to play preview audio clips smoothly.
